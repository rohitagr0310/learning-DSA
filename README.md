# DSA Learning Repository

## Overview
This repository contains my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from basic to advanced levels. It includes well-structured implementations of various DSA concepts, problem-solving approaches, and optimization techniques.

## Topics Covered
- **Arrays**: Basics, operations, and problem-solving
- **Linked Lists**: Single, double, circular linked lists
- **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation and applications
- **Trees**: Binary trees, BST, traversals, and advanced tree structures
- **Graphs**: BFS, DFS, shortest path algorithms, and MST
- **Recursion & Backtracking**: Classic problems and optimization techniques
- **Dynamic Programming**: Tabulation and memoization approaches
- **Sorting & Searching**: Various sorting algorithms and search techniques
- **Miscellaneous**: Bit manipulation, sliding window, and two-pointer techniques

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rohitagr0310/learning-DSA.git
